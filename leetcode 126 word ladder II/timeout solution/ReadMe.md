I reviewed all blogs related to Leetcode 126, and then I reviewed the code based on [the blog](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2016/05/leetcode-126-word-ladder-ii-warm-up_52.html):<br>

The code has time limit exceeded problem. 

Based on the experience starting from 2016, I understand that it is better to work on an easy level or medium level algorithm first. Divide the hard level algorithm into a few of easy or medium level algorithms first. And I should work on easy one first.
