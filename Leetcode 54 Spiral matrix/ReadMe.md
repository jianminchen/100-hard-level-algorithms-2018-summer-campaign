I asked the question on code review site. [Here](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/185935/leetcode-54-spiral-matrix?rq=1) is the link. <br>

I like to spend more time to review the algorithm. Sometimes it takes time for me to be humble, and understand review I got more than a year ago. 

The idea is to use same idea [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/discuss/20573/a-concise-c-implementation-based-on-directions).<br>
