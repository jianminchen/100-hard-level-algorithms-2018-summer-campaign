I like to write a big thanks for those big software giants to give me chance to learn one more hard level algorithm this summer. 

It is the hard level algorithm called merge k sorted lists. It can be solved using merge sort, and then the time complexity can be lowered down compared to naive handling one by one. Also it can be handled by using minimum heap, and then all items in the k sorted listed can be added to the minimum heap for one time. And then the list can be constructed by one by one.

Here is my blog about Leetcode 23 merge k sorted lists.

In order to understand SortedDictionary.First, I need to study and memorize all APIs for IEnumerable interface. I also need to customize minimum heap/ max heap according by defining key value, one tip is to use negative value to turn maximum heap to minimum heap easily. 

[Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.first?view=netframework-4.8) is the page I should read and memorize. <br>


IEnumerable Interface <br>

Aggregate<br>
All<br>
Any<br>
Append<br>
AsEnumerable<br>
Average<br>
Cast<br>
Concat<br>
Contains<br>
Count<br>
DefaultEmpty<br>
Distinct<br>
ElementAt<br>
ElementAtOrDefault<br>
Empty<br>
Except<br>
First<br>
FirstOrDefault<br>
GroupBy<br>


Another data structure to look into <br>

BTree - self-balancing binary search tree<br>
Skip Lists - A linked list with self-balancing BST-like properties<br>
