I like to write a big thanks for those big software giants to give me chance to learn one more hard level algorithm this summer. 

It is the hard level algorithm called merge k sorted lists. It can be solved using merge sort, and then the time complexity can be lowered down compared to naive handling one by one. Also it can be handled by using minimum heap, and then all items in the k sorted listed can be added to the minimum heap for one time. And then the list can be constructed by one by one.
