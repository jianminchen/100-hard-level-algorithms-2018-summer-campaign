It is my job to push myself to come out the optimal solution in 2019. In order to compete the best job on the market, I have to leanr how to push myself. Once I come out the idea to solve the problem, I should work on optimize right away. Ask myself if I can use less space, less time, what is alternative. Do not wait others to give me hint. Go for the best one. 

Strive to be the best. Make sure that I try to write all kinds of ideas in the practice first.
