This is the algorithm I asked in mock interview over five times. 

Given a binary tree, output all nodes in vertically order from left to right. If two nodes are in the same horizontal position, then the order will not be specified. In other words, the nodes can be in any order. 

I was told after the mock interview that the algorithm can be solved without using hashmap, and also no need to sort keys. <br>
[Feb. 9 mock interview as an interviewee](https://leetcode.com/problems/vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree/discuss/504546/C-vertical-traverse-binary-tree-algorithm-(trial-and-error)-in-2020) <br>

The interviewee was the manager of FANG (Facebook, Apple, Amzon, Linkedin, Microsoft, Google). He wrote the optimal solution, and also only leftmost horizontal position is found. Good design.
