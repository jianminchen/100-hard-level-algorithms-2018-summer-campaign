[Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2019/09/one-day-vacation-island-count-ii.html) is the blog related to my study of algorithm 305 Island Count II. <br>

My first practice <br>

I like to document my first practice, here is highlights:<br>

1. Fully test the code before running the test cases. 
2. Check index-out-of-range error
3. Review union find algorithm, understand how to write recursive function called findRoot. 
4. Since id value is from 0 to m * n - 1, so the default value is ok with -1.
