I decided to add the algorithm in 100 hard level algorithms repository. I choose to continue to learn the algorithm as an interviewer, and I will document later how many areas I should work on in order to write bug-free code, what is most important to design the algorithm, make it cut for 20 minutes performance.

[Leetcode 33 search in rotated sorted array](https://gist.github.com/jianminchen/cda9ef8e8d11c8d3259c916f90488c16) bug free code, second algorithm in mock interview, less than 25 minutes<br>

[Leetcode 33 search in rotated sorted array](https://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2020/03/case-study-search-in-rotated-sorted_4.html) Interviewee has super good performance, he finished code less than 10 minutes, bug-free<br>

I start to build very good relationships with one algorithm, people I interviewed. Recently I interviewed a young engineer from Facebook using this algorithm, and also connected him using wechat. <br>

Every algorithm comes with sweet memory. Let learning and crafting skills grow with more connections in this small world. Coronavirus makes us connected this March 2002. <br>

[Leetcode 33 search in rotated sorted array](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2020/03/case-study-search-in-rotated-sorted_31.html) Interviewee is a facebook engineer with 2 yrs experience<br>

The above code is bug-free, which can pass Leetcode online judge. The interviewee is very talent to write bug-free code and just use his own whiteboard testing skills. Bravo!<br>
