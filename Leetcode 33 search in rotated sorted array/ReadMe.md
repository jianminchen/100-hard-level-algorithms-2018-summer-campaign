I start to build very good relationships with one algorithm, people I interviewed. Recently I interviewed a young engineer from Facebook using this algorithm, and also connected to wechat group. <br>

Every algorithm comes with sweet memory. Let learning and crafting skills grow with more connections in this small world. Coronavirus makes us connected. <br>
