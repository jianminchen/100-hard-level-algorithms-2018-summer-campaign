I start to build very good relationships with one algorithm, people I interviewed. Recently I interviewed a young engineer from Facebook using this algorithm, and also connected him using wechat. <br>

Every algorithm comes with sweet memory. Let learning and crafting skills grow with more connections in this small world. Coronavirus makes us connected this March 2002. <br>

[Leetcode 33 search in rotated sorted array](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2020/03/case-study-search-in-rotated-sorted_31.html) Interviewee is a facebook engineer with 2 yrs experience<br>

The above code is bug-free, which can pass Leetcode online judge. The interviewee is very talent to write bug-free code and just use his own whiteboard testing skills. Bravo!<br>
