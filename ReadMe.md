It is always good to push yourself to think hard and aim the optimal solution in terms of time complexity. Last Thursday I had chance to work on the algorithm called "construct a binary expression tree using infix expression" in 30 minutes. Since I do not take risk to go for the optimal solution using O(N) and stack data structure, I learn the lesson again. 

I like to start to put together 100 hard level algorithms practice and learning changing my life as a sofware programmer. I need to get organized and also strive to think more often for those hard level algorithms.
