Go back to algorithm practice project<br>

I like to go back to algorithm practice. After more than six month break, I like to practice algorithm again. The idea is to write over 10 ideas for Leetcode 236 Lowest common ancestor. I also like to review my mock interview experience in 2019, here is the discussion link. <br>
