The learning experience is so great. I worked on weekly contest in NOv. 2018, this algorihtm is one of 4 algorithms. But I did not have time to learn and solve the problem until this March 2019. <br>

What happened? <br>

I was busy working on personal finance research. I did not learn that the best place to learn this algorithm is to go through top 200 players on this weekly contest and went over their submissions. 

Blogs to document the learning<br>

[Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/search?q=leetcode+947) are blogs to look up from my coding blog related to the algorithm.
