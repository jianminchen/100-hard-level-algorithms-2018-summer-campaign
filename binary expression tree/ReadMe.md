Let me document how long it takes me to get ready for the algorithm called infix expression to binary expression tree.

30 minutes to write a brute force solutin without implementation of parser, I did not have time to write code for parser. 
Time complexity is O(N^2). The parse of the expression is too complicated to write

Study binary expression tree, and also read the article and code to convert infix expression to postfix expression etc. 

Blogs related to study are the following:

A peer worked on the algorithm more than 30 minutes. I observed how he tried to solve the problem. He does not have the idea to use stack to parse the string.

Spent more than 30 minutes in mock interview and watch a peer how he solved the problem using stack. He knew the optimal solution using stack and optimal time complexity O(N).

Wrote a question on stackexchange.com and asked code review. Here is the link:

I study the coding blog about [all Leetcode algorithm by grand yang](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/4606334.html), and I came cross this medium level algorithm:
[Leetcode 224. Basic Calculator](http://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/4570699.html)<br>.
