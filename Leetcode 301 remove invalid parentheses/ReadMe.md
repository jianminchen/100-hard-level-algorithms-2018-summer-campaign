Introduction

It is hard level algorithm and I have to review the algorithm first. Most of important is that I have to understand how to write working code, and then pass online judge. I reviewed one of submissions I did more than 6 months ago. 

Most of important is to write a story how to solve the problem using test case "()())()". I found this test case through my last submission. I have to explain my solution based on this test case. 

Story first, code follows

I have to write a story how to work on the test case, I have to write a story. And then I need to conduct time complexity as well. 

I put the story in the function specification. I reviewed the code and made some changes. 


Here is the code.
