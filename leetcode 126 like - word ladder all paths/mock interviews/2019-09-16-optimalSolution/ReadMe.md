[Here](https://gist.github.com/jianminchen/11b4ecf23ce1ba1094e3aa938631245b) is Java code written in mock interview by the interviewee, the code passes two test cases. I reviewed the code as well. 

The interviewee and I discussed the recursive function and possible stack overflow. I checked Google and stack size is 64KB. Given the word with length 5, dictionary size can up to 1 million words, and then length of path can up to 1 million as well. So it is one of concerns in terms of design of DFS function. 

The interviewee stayed anonymout, but he told me that he got Microsoft, Oracle and Uber onsite. He is very competitive.
