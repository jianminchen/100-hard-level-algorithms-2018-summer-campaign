It is my determination to learn from others on this graph algorithms. I like to interview people and also cultivate strong interest in algorithm analysis, and learn from best performers related to algorithms as well. <br>
[Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2019/09/case-study-word-ladder-find-all-paths_23.html) is the blog to document another mock interview, the interviewee solved the algorithm using BFS, and he also tested the code to make sure that all test cases run ok.
